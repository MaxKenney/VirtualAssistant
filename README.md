# Virtual Assistant

This is the repo for our virtual assistant AI.

## Setup

- First Make sure you have installed <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node js</a>

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/ReeceKenney/VirtualAssistant`

### Setup

From terminal, cd into the repo and then install the required dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```
>FYI: This will add all the dependencies in the node_modules folder. This is needed to run the project but you don't need to care about this folder or it's contents. This folder can get quite large when we add more dependencies so I have added this to the .gitignore file so git will not take any notice of it (this is why we need to run `npm install` - to generate this folder). 

From terminal, start the server:

```shell
$ npm start
```
